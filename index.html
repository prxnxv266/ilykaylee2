    kaylee i always adored you and i know you loved me very much and i know you still do, and im a kind of person that enjoys each and every moment that we're living. I know not everything lasts long. When you used to do something cute for me, or just even add my name on your discord bio, i used to love it so much, i never said to you about it, but it meant so much for me, so fucking much. You have helped me so much kaylee. You can see the things im talking about below. I used to take screenshots of these to keep it with me forever and maybe even show you when we meet and have a good laugh about it. It's so cute.üíñ

  <p class="max-w-2xl mx-auto text-lg mb-6">
    Kaylee, you already know how much you meant to me and how much i loved you. Being in a long distance relationship is hard and it made it even harder when we didn't use to talk regularly, or even on call, because i wanted to know about your daily life, how your day went and made sure youre fine. But, without that, i still made time or thought of some things to make this relationship come lively. Following are some things that i did that you can see and keep it with you for the rest of your life. I had and still have some more plans for your birthday and ofcourse for our relationship but it wont be possible without you being with me. It'd only happen if we'll still be together but if not then i'll just have to take it to my grave.

  <p class="mb-4 text-lg max-w-xl mx-auto">that is it. Kaylee, people say that if you really want something, you should try your hardest and give it a second chance. And i still want you and us, and hopefully you read the last bit of the book, so that told you something. If you're still interested and think we can make this work like you used to say that "we're gonna make this relationship work either way", just think about it, dont think too much about commitments and stuff, we'll both figure this out and i know we will. We got this. but if youre over us then this is probably a last goodbye to you as your boyfriend. You still have to let me know about this though.<br>
We can still be friends and try to text often, but it still depends on you on how busy you are. I'm not gonna force you into it, you know what to do. I know whatever decision you'll take, it'll be good for you and at the end, thats all i care about. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<strong>I LOVE YOU.</strong></p>
